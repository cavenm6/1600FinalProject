# **1. What Is HTTP?**

HTTP stands for **Hypertext Transfer Protocol**, and it is the foundational system that allows web browsers and web servers to communicate. Whenever you click a link, open a website, submit a form, or load an image online, HTTP is the protocol working behind the scenes to deliver the information.

## Client–Server Model

HTTP uses a **client–server** structure:

- The **client** (usually a web browser) sends a *request*.
- The **server** receives the request, processes it, and sends back a *response*.


This back-and-forth exchange happens extremely fast—often in just milliseconds.

## What HTTP Does
HTTP controls:
- How a message is formatted  
- How the client asks for a resource  
- How the server delivers content (HTML, images, videos, data, etc.)  
- How to handle errors (such as “404 Not Found”)  

It is a **stateless protocol**, meaning:
- Each request is independent  
- The server does not automatically remember previous interactions

## Why HTTP Matters
- It powers all basic web browsing  
- It is used by websites, APIs, mobile apps, and cloud services  
- Understanding HTTP makes other technologies easier to learn  
- It is essential for careers in IT, cybersecurity, development, networking, and digital systems
