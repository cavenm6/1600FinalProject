# **1. What Is HTTP?**

HTTP stands for **Hypertext Transfer Protocol**, and it is the foundational system that allows web browsers and web servers to communicate. Whenever you click a link, open a website, submit a form, or load an image online, HTTP is the protocol working behind the scenes to deliver the information.

## Client–Server Model

HTTP uses a **client–server** structure:

- The **client** (usually a web browser) sends a *request*.
- The **server** receives the request, processes it, and sends back a *response*.
